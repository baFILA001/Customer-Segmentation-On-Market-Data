## Introduction
Customer segmentation is a vital strategy in marketing that involves dividing a broad target market into smaller, more manageable segments. These segments share similar characteristics, allowing businesses to tailor their marketing efforts for maximum effectiveness.

## Installation
Ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn dataprep yellowbrick scikit-learn
```

## Usage
To use this script, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
2. Modify the script according to your specific dataset and requirements.
3. Run the script using a Python environment.

## Libraries Used
- **numpy**: For numerical operations and array handling.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **matplotlib**: For creating visualizations.
- **seaborn**: For enhancing the visual aesthetics of plots.
- **dataprep.eda**: For exploratory data analysis (EDA) and reporting.
- **sklearn**: For data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and clustering.
- **yellowbrick**: For visualizing KMeans clustering results.

## Script Explanation
1. **Importing Libraries**: Importing necessary Python libraries for data analysis, visualization, and clustering.
2. **Styling**: Setting the plot style to a dark background for a visually appealing display.
3. **Data Preparation**: Using functions from sklearn and dataprep.eda to preprocess and analyze the dataset.
4. **Label Encoding and Standard Scaling**: Preprocessing techniques to prepare data for clustering.
5. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Dimensionality reduction to aid in clustering.
6. **KMeans Clustering**: Using KMeans algorithm for clustering and determining optimal clusters.
7. **Visualizing Clusters**: Using the elbow method to select the optimal number of clusters and visualizing the results.


## Results
The script provides insights into customer segmentation using KMeans clustering and visualization of the clustered data. The results help in understanding distinct customer groups within the market data.
